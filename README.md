# python_script_typing_game
A typing game in one file, which utilizes the "words_alpha" dictionary found here https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

**Purpose
Quick program to try out the threads library. Having an additional thread along with the main thread allows for an in game timer, making the typing game possible.

**Instruction
Download and run version2, which is the better version that loads the words in a dictionary first to avoid load times during the game. The first version is still included to see my imporvement, but not recommended to play
